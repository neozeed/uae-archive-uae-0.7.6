Note! This file only contains user-visible changes. There may be others. For a
more detailed description of changes between releases, read src/ChangeLog, and
for the full picture, make a diff between releases.

User-visible changes in 0.7.6:
  - Bug fixes
  - Might work with BSD make

User-visible changes in 0.7.5:
  - Fixed compilation bugs on Linux ELF systems (sorry!)
  - Better gtk detection (hopefully)

(version 0.7.4 left out for, er, technical reasons)

User-visible changes in 0.7.3:
  - Fixed bugs that made the low bandwidth feature and dithered color output
    unusable in the X11 version.
  - Fixed compilation bugs on BSD systems (Krister Walfridsson)

User-visible changes in 0.7.2:
  - Picasso bug fixed that caused corruption of window scrollbars.
  - BeOS update (Christian Bauer)

User-visible changes in 0.7.1:
  - Fixed a display bug that caused dual playfield displays in high resolution
    to look wrong.
  - The gtk UI no longer crashes when the "-G" option is used.

User-visible changes in 0.7.0:
  - Picasso96 graphics card emulation by Brian King.
  - All CPU emulations (68000, 68010, 68020, 68020 + FPU, 68000 compatible)
    are now compiled into one binary and selectable at run-time.
  - Many changes in hardfile support. Now you can mount several hardfiles in
    arbitrary order. You can specify the geometry for every hardfile.
    The hardfile device has been renamed to "uaehf.device". Please adjust your
    MountList entry.
  - Stereo sound support
  - UAE has been ported to pOS by Samuel Devulder
  - New sound back-end that just writes sound to a file.
  - Improved serial support
  - The XFree86 VidMode extension is supported; if you use it, the X11 version
    will switch to the video mode that is "closest" to what you specified on
    the commandline.
  - Many minor and major bugfixes

User-visible changes in 0.6.9:
  - The sprite code finally seems to work now (well, mostly :( )
  - Sprite-to-sprite collisions implemented
  - EHB and dual playfield modes are faster on x86 systems.
  - Disk changes should be detected again.
  - Believe it or not, I think the reset and quit buttons in the UI actually
    work this time.
  - POSIX_PENGUINS for Linux systems with glibc-2.0. There's now real hope
    that it speeds things up on SMP machines (it still slows down single
    processor machines if it's enabled, though).
  - The filesystem code should be somewhat more robust. It can also be set up
    to run multi-threaded. That makes sense even on single processor machines.
  - The old follow-mouse hack for the X version is disabled. There is now a
    new Amiga program named "mousehack". Please put it in the directory you
    use for harddisk emulation and put the command "run >NIL: mousehack" in 
    your startup-sequence.
  - 4 or 8 MB chip memory are supported.
  - Two joysticks are supported on Linux systems, as well as several
    alternative keyboard "fake" joysticks (using two simultaneously is
    possible). Also, two joystick buttons are now supported.
  - The SVGAlib/DOS version user interface is a bit improved. It can now be
    used during the emulation by pressing F11, e.g. for changing disks.
  - For the non-DGA X11 version, the LOW_BANDWITH and DONT_WANT_SHM compile
    options have been turned into the -L and -T run-time options.
  - Linux/GGI port by Christian Schmitt/Stefan Reinauer (untested)

User-visible changes in 0.6.8:
  - This should contain all the necessary files...
  - Bugfixes

User-visible changes in 0.6.7:
  - Some bugs in the new playfield code removed; some speed improvements
  - New alternate user-interface for X (note the debugger doesn't completely
    work yet). The Tk GUI is also improved. Note that I don't use either, so
    there are no stability guarantees.
  - The options "-d" and "-C" are replaced with "-O", which allows much better
    control over the graphics display. The old options will continue to work
    for a few more releases and will be removed after that.
  - Yet Another Blitter Bug fixed (Sanity Arte demo)
  - Blitter control by copper now works (would have worked before if I hadn't
    forgotten the COPCON register)
  - On Linux systems (running at least kernel version 1.3.something) UAE can
    now be set up to run in two threads. That's only potentially useful on SMP
    machines, it's a performance loss on other machines. It currently is most
    probably a big performance loss even on SMP machines: The implementation
    is very primitive. This is just to get started.

User-visible changes in 0.6.6:
  - Playfield hardware emulation almost completely rewritten. It _should_ be
    somewhat more stable and bugfree, but there's no doubt that there are some
    new fun and exciting bugs in this version.
    Features: Interlace drawing merges two frames and should look better, plus
      it now works with even frame skip values.
      The copper is more accurate.
      Sprite DMA works better (see Interference by Sanity)
      Some other bugs removed.
  - The spanish keyboard now has a "W".
  - Nice pictures in the Tk GUI.
  - The USER_PROGRAMS_BEHAVE compile-time option now "works" even if you don't
    use the compiler.

User-visible changes in 0.6.5:
  - Bugfixes in the filesystem code and in the compiler
  - There was some speed loss in 0.6.4, which should be fixed for the i386
    versions. Actually, UAE won't run on a 386 anymore (uses the bswapl
    instruction). It would be pointless anyway...
  - The text user interface in the SVGAlib and DOS versions supports harddisks
    better
  - The XFree86 DGA extension is supported.
  - Italian documentation by Paolo Besser.
  - Spanish keyboard support for X; French keyboard updated
  - I _hope_ that the X version UAE now always resets keyboard autorepeat.
  - Option "-A" to control the accuracy of the emulation. Use "-A 0" to
    restore the old behaviour, which is likely to be somewhat faster.
  - Solaris sound should actually compile this time.
  - The built-in debugger has a "M" command to search for sound modules.

For versions earlier than 0.6.5, you'll have to read the ChangeLog to find out
what's new.
